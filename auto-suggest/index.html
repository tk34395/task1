        Auto Suggest Pattern
    </h1>    
    <h2>
        Use When:
    </h2>
    <p>
        We are beginning a search and might be uncertain about specific terminologies or seeking insights into trending or
        popular search terms. This is especially relevant when we are initiating a new research project or delving into an
        unfamiliar field.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How:
    </h2>
    <p>
        The AutoSuggest feature activates as soon as we start typing in the search bar. It's a dynamic and responsive tool that
        immediately displays a list of predictive suggestions based on each keystroke. These suggestions are generated through a
        sophisticated algorithm that takes into account various factors, including the popularity of searches (what others have
        frequently searched for), our own search history (personalized suggestions based on our past queries), and the relevance
        of these suggestions to the partial terms we've already entered. The system is adept at adapting with each character we
        type, continuously refining the suggestions to be as pertinent as possible. This interactive experience not only
        accelerates the search process but also assists us in crafting effective search queries.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Ideal Use:
    </h2>
    <p>
        AutoSuggest is a valuable asset for us, final year computing students, particularly in the early stages of our research.
        It's like having a savvy assistant that not only expedites our search process but also provides insights into pertinent
        academic topics and terminologies. For example, when I type "simultaneous localization" I receive suggestions like 
        "simultaneous localization and mapping", "simultaneous localization and mapping slam", "simultaneous localization and 
        mapping review" etc. This opens up various avenues for in-depth study. This feature is crucial for students like us who 
        are exploring new areas of study or need assistance in refining our research questions with greater precision. It 
        effectively narrows the divide between general knowledge and specialized academic jargon, making the initial research 
        process less intimidating and more targeted.
