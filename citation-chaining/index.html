    <h1>
        Citation Chaining
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Use When:
    </h2>
    <p>
        We are delving into the literature surrounding a specific research paper and wish to explore its academic lineage and
        influence. This is particularly relevant when we have identified a pivotal paper and aim to trace its impact both
        backward and forward in the scholarly dialogue.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Citation chaining works in two directions: forward chaining and backward chaining. Forward chaining entails
        investigating which subsequent papers have cited the paper in question, thus enabling us to observe the influence and
        evolution originating from the original work. Conversely, backward chaining involves examining the references cited
        within the paper itself, offering us insight into the foundational works and theories that underpin it. Academic search
        engines and databases support this process by providing hyperlinked citations that we can readily follow, effectively
        chaining together a series of related works.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Ideal Use:
    </h2>
    <p>
        For us, final year computing students, citation chaining is an essential tool. It enables us to build a well-informed
        narrative about the evolution of specific theories or technologies. For example, a student delving into machine learning
        algorithms can trace the development of particular algorithms, comprehend various improvements over time, and explore
        the diverse applications that have emerged. This approach is invaluable not only in understanding the academic and
        historical context of a topic but also in pinpointing seminal works and current thought leaders in our field. It serves
        as an excellent method to uncover hidden connections and trends that might not be immediately evident through standard
        search techniques.
