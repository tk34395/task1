        Research Paper Bookmarking
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Use When:
    </h2>
    <p>
        We are currently in the midst of collecting numerous research papers and require a systematic method to organize,
        review, and interact with these documents effectively.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How:
    </h2>
    <p>
        This user interface pattern provides a digital space where users can save academic papers they find during their
        research. It goes beyond simple bookmarking; users can annotate these papers directly within the platform. This may
        include highlighting key sections, adding personal notes, or even attaching external resources. The papers can be
        categorized into different folders or lists, allowing for easy retrieval and organization. Some platforms also offer
        tagging systems, where users can tag papers with custom keywords for even more refined organization.

    <h2>
        Ideal Use:
    </h2>
    <p>
        For us, final year computing students who often grapple with complex and multifaceted research topics, this tool is
        indispensable. It assists in tracking the extensive literature we need to review and interact with. The capability to
        add personal annotations allows us to note our initial reactions, thoughts, or questions directly on the paper, which
        proves incredibly beneficial when we revisit the material later for writing or discussion. This approach fosters a
        deeper level of engagement with the literature, as we are not merely passively reading but actively engaging with the
        content.        
        The functionality to categorize and tag papers is especially valuable in the field of computing, where research can be
        exceedingly specialized and intricate. We can establish categories based on different subfields, methodologies, or even
        specific aspects of our projects. Such organization is crucial during the synthesis phase of our research, where we need
        to integrate information from diverse sources to develop coherent arguments and insights.
