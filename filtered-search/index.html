        Filtered Search
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Use When:
    </h2>
    <p>
        We are faced with a large volume of search results and need to refine these to focus on the most relevant documents for
        our research topic.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Filtered Search offers us a range of criteria or facets to refine our search results. These filters typically encompass
        options like date range, document type (such as articles, conference papers, theses), author names, publication sources
        (journals, conferences), and specific keywords. We can apply these filters either individually or in combination,
        effectively narrowing down the search results to a more targeted and pertinent set. Advanced systems might provide
        additional filters like citation counts, research methods, specific research topics, or even the impact factor of
        journals. The interface for Filtered Search is generally user-friendly, enabling easy toggling and adjustment of filters
        to continuously refine the search outcomes.

    </p>
    <h2>
        Ideal Use:
    </h2>
    <p>
        In academic research, particularly within computing and related fields, managing the vast amount of literature can be
        daunting. Filtered Search emerges as an essential tool in these situations. It empowers students, researchers, and
        academics to efficiently navigate through copious information, pinpointing content that is most relevant to their
        specific research needs. For instance, a computing student focusing on machine learning might utilize filters to
        showcase only recent publications from high-impact conferences, thereby accessing the most current and relevant research
        in the field. This functionality is particularly beneficial for conducting comprehensive literature reviews, where
        accuracy in selecting pertinent, recent, and high-quality sources is paramount. Moreover, for interdisciplinary studies,
        such as projects that merge computing with healthcare or environmental science, filters are invaluable for isolating
        papers that intersect these different disciplines.
