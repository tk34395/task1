    <h1>
        Citation Analysis Tool
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Use When:
    </h2>
    <p>
        We are aiming to grasp the wider academic significance and context of a particular paper, encompassing its influence
        within the field, the frequency and nature of its citations, and its position in the broader spectrum of research.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How:
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Citation Analysis Tool, available in numerous academic databases, is a resource we can use to explore the citation
        network around a specific paper. This network reveals how often the paper has been cited and identifies the papers that
        have referenced it. More advanced versions of this tool provide in-depth analytical metrics, such as citation trends
        over time, shedding light on the paper's increasing or decreasing influence. Additionally, certain tools offer insights
        into the geographic distribution of the citing authors, highlighting the global impact and extent of the research.
        Another advanced feature is the analysis of the fields of study of the citing papers, which can uncover
        interdisciplinary interest in and applications of the research findings.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Ideal Use:
    </h2>
    <p>
        For us, final year computing students, particularly those immersed in advanced research projects, thesis writing, or
        preparing for an academic career, this tool is indispensable. It enables us to pinpoint seminal works that have
        significantly shaped our field, thus guiding our literature reviews and research directions. Grasping citation trends is
        crucial for identifying enduring research and emerging works that are gaining prominence. Additionally, by exploring the
        range of fields citing a specific paper, we can uncover insights into potential interdisciplinary applications of our
        work, a vital aspect in computing where technology intersects with various domains.        
        The capability to examine the geographic distribution of citations also enlightens us about global research centers and
        collaborations in our field, which is invaluable for networking and comprehending international research dynamics. In
        essence, the Citation Analysis Tool not only assists in our literature review but also helps us position our research
        within the global academic framework, a key competence for budding researchers.
